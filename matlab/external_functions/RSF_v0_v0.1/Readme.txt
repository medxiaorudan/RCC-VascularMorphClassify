This package includes two folders:

LBF_v0: 
This is the Matlab code that implements the local binary fitting (LBF) model in Chunming Li et al's paper:
     "Minimization of Region-Scalable Fitting Energy for Image Segmentation",
      IEEE Trans. Image Processing, vol. 17 (10), pp.1940-1949, 2008.

LBF_v0.1: 
This code implements an improved algorithm slightly modified from the original LBF model in the above paper. 
A desirable advantage of this improved version of LBF algorithm is that it is very robust to contour initialization.
