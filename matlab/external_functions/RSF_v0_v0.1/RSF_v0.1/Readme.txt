This code demomstrates an improved algorithm based on the local binary fitting (LBF) model
in Chunming Li et al's paper:
    "Minimization of Region-Scalable Fitting Energy for Image Segmentation", 
     IEEE Trans. Image Processing, vol. 17 (10), pp.1940-1949, 2008.


Usage: These codes can be used for Matlab 7.0.4 or higher versions in Windows. 

       Run the Demos in the M-files for several test images. Once an image comes out, click
       the mouse to generate a polygon as the initial contour: left click to get 
       a number of points, then right click to get the end point.

       The number of iterations may need to be increased if the initial contour is too far 
       away from the desired object boundary.
