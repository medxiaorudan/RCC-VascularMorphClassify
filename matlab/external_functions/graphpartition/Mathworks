An Efficient MATLAB Algorithm for Graph Partitioning



This script implements a graph partitioning algorithm based on
spectral factorization. This algorithm is described in the following
technical report:

João Hespanha. An efficient MATLAB Algorithm for Graph
Partitioning. Technical Report, University of California,
Oct. 2004. Available at
http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~hespanha/techreps.html

The script is used as follows:

% function [ndx,Pi,cost]= grPartition(C,k,nrep);
%
% Partitions the n-node undirected graph G defined by the matrix C
% 
% Inputs:
% C - n by n edge-weights matrix. In particular, c(i,j)=c(j,i) is equal 
%     to the cost associated with cuting the edge between nodes i and j.
%     This matrix should be symmetric and doubly stochastic. If this
%     is not the case, this matrix will be normalized to
%     satisfy these properties (with a warning).
% k - desired number of partitions
% nrep - number of repetion for the clustering algorithm 
%       (optional input, defaults to 1)
% 
% Outputs:
% ndx  - n-vector with the cluster index for every node 
%       (indices from 1 to k)
% Pi   - Projection matrix [see Technical report
% cost - cost of the partition (sum of broken edges)
